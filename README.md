# Text-Deduplication
CMPE 452 project to determine text similarity, which can then be used to filter a news feed of similar content

# Architecture
There are artificial neural network models used to solve this problem. All of them rely on Siamese networks.

- Recurrent Neural Network
- Long Short Term Memory Netowrk
- Simple Feedforward Network
